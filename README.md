# E-commerce Data Analysis Project

## Project Overview and use cases
This project focuses on analyzing e-commerce data to uncover trends and insights about customer behavior, purchase preferences, and transactional data. The dataset includes various attributes such as customer address, transaction details, credit card information, and purchase price, providing a rich source for exploring trends in online purchasing patterns.

## Tools and Technologies
- **Python**: Used for data cleaning, exploration, and analysis.
- **Pandas**: For handling data structures and performing operations like grouping and filtering.
- **Matplotlib/Seaborn**: For data visualization and creating insights.
- **Jupyter Notebook**: For interactive coding and documentation.

## Key Analysis & Insights
The analysis performed on the dataset includes the following:

1. **Customer Purchase Trends**
   - Analyzed purchase times (AM vs. PM) to determine if customers prefer buying in the morning or evening.
   - Examined the distribution of purchases across different companies.

2. **Purchase Price Distribution**
   - Created a histogram to visualize the distribution of purchase prices, identifying common price ranges for transactions.

3. **Credit Card Analysis**
   - Filtered transactions by credit card provider to explore which providers are most popular.
   - Analyzed credit card expiration dates to check if expiring cards are associated with purchase trends.

4. **Job and Purchase Correlation**
   - Explored the relationship between customer jobs and purchase prices to understand if certain job roles correlate with higher or lower purchase amounts.

5. **Browser Analysis**
   - Examined the browser information to identify which browsers are most frequently used during purchases.

6. **Email Domain Analysis**
   - Extracted the email domains to find the most popular email providers among customers.

## Visualizations
- **Bar charts**: Used to show browser usage distribution and credit card provider popularity.
- **Histograms**: Visualized the distribution of purchase prices to understand customer spending behavior.
- **Scatter plots**: Explored relationships between job titles and purchase prices.
- **Pie charts**: Showed the proportion of purchases made during AM vs. PM.
